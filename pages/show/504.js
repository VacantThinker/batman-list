    <h1>Batman Beyond</h1>
    <p><b>Batman Beyond</b> tells the story of Terry McGinnis was just an ordinary teenager...until his father was
      mysteriously murdered. Suspecting foul play at his father's company Wayne/Powers Corporation, Terry meets Bruce
      Wayne and learns a secret identity hidden for decades. Now too old to battle injustice, Wayne is a bitter shell of
      his former self and refuses to help. So Terry does what any brash young kid would do: steal the Batsuit and take
      matters into his own hands! Vowing to avenge his father's death, Terry dons the high-tech suit - tricked out with
      jetpacks for flying, a supersensitive microphone for eavesdropping and even camouflage capabilities - in search of
      his father's assassin.</p>
