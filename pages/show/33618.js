          identities as millionaire philanthropist Bruce Wayne and his young
          ward Dick Grayson and known only to Alfred, the faithful butler. Ever
          alert, they respond swiftly to a signal from the police, and moments
          later, from the secret Batcave deep beneath Wayne Manor, they roar out
          to protect life, limb and property as Batman and Robin, caped
          crimefighters! Batman and Robin, scourge of Gotham City's kooky
          criminals: The Joker, Clown Prince of Crime - The Penguin, pudgy
          purveyor of perfidy - and the cool, cruel, Mr. Freeze! Watch out,
          villains, here come... Batman and Robin!
