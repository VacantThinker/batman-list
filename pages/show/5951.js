    <h1>The New Batman Adventures</h1>
    <p>
      <b>The New Batman Adventures</b> comes from the creators of Batman and
      Superman. This series was created because Fox had not lived up to the
      contract that they had given Batman, so the WB decided to give the show
      another chance. Bruce Timm then went back and decided to re-design all of
      the characters from Batman and ended up revamping the series all-together.
