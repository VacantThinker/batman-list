          <b>The New Batman Adventures</b> comes from the creators of Batman and
          Superman. This series was created because Fox had not lived up to the
          contract that they had given Batman, so the WB decided to give the
          show another chance. Bruce Timm then went back and decided to
          re-design all of the characters from Batman and ended up revamping the
          series all-together.
