    <h1>Batman</h1>
    <p>
      Wealthy entrepreneur Bruce Wayne and his ward Dick Grayson lead a double
      life: they are actually crime fighting duo Batman and Robin. A secret
      Batpole in the Wayne mansion leads to the Batcave, where Police
      Commissioner Gordon often calls with the latest emergency threatening
      Gotham City. Racing to the scene of the crime in the Batmobile, Batman and
      Robin must (with the help of their trusty Bat-utility-belt) thwart the
      efforts of a variety of master criminals, including Catwoman, Egghead, The
      Joker, King Tut, The Penguin, and The Riddler.
