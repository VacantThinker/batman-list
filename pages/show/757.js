          Experience the thrills of vigilante justice as millionaire playboy
          Bruce Wayne and alter-ego Batman protect the streets of Gotham City
          from a host of villains including archnemesis The Joker,
          deadly-beautiful Poison Ivy and primitive Killer Croc in a fresh take
          on super hero storytelling. Intelligent, dramatic stories, unique
          characters and sharp dialog shaped this edgy TV series into an
          EmmyÂ®-winning powerhouse that brought the Caped Crusader out of the
          dark alleys of TV history and into the present for fans of all ages.
