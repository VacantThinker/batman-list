    <h1>Beware the Batman</h1>
    <p>In this new interpretation of the Batman legend, Bruce Wayne has recently returned to Gotham. With the aide of
      his butler and former SAS operative Alfred Pennyworth, Bruce takes on the guise of Batman and fights the villains
      of Gotham City. Helping him is Katana, a young martial artist who Alfred hires to assist Bruce when he realizes
      that he's too old to serve in the field.</p>
