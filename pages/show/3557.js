    <h1>Beware the Batman</h1>
    <p>
      In this new interpretation of the Batman legend, Bruce Wayne has recently
      returned to Gotham. With the aide of his butler and former SAS operative
      Alfred Pennyworth, Bruce takes on the guise of Batman and fights the
      villains of Gotham City. Helping him is Katana, a young martial artist who
      Alfred hires to assist Bruce when he realizes that he's too old to serve
      in the field.
